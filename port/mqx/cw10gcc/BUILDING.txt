Notes on building the Lightweight Platform Abstraction (lwpa) library for
MQX 4.2/CodeWarrior 10.6 (gcc toolchain)

== Workspace Variables ==

A workspace-level variable is needed to point the lwpa project at the MQX
headers that it needs to build:
    MQX_BOARD_DIR: The location of your project's MQX build directory
                   (of the form .../MQX/v4.2.0/lib/[your board].cw10gcc)
Set this variable in Window -> Preferences -> General -> Workspace ->
Linked Resources.

== Project Configurations ==

"debug" includes debugging information and has no optimizations. "release"
includes no debugging information and is optimized for size.

== Output ==

The static lib will be copied to lib/mqx/cw10gcc/liblwpa[d].a. From there it
can be linked into your project. Your project's include paths should include:
    lwpa/include
    lwpa/include/mqx
